# WeatherApp
"# WeatherApp" 

 This app is built in React, with a MongoDB/Mongoose backend that allows users to save favorite locations. It also incorporates authentication so that users can create new usernames and passwords for their accounts.

It was built as a way for users to look up the weather in any location by city and state or country. It uses a powerful weather API that gives forecasts, humidity, "feels like" temperatures, and other helpful information.

In addition to being a fully CRUD application, this app includes a database which allows users to store their favorite cities for reference. 

Once weather from a certain location has been requested, a switch statement determines which picture should display behind each day's weather data. This way, users can see at a glance what kind of weather will predominate that week.
